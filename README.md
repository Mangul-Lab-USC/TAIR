# The Atlas of Immunoglobulin Repertoires (TheAIR)


![](https://github.com/smangul1/TheAIR/blob/master/TheAIR.logo.png)

## What is TheAIR
TheAIR is a collection of immunoglobulin (Ig) clonotypes across 53 tissues from 544 individuals. CDR3 sequences were assembled from by [ImReP](https://github.com/mandricigor/imrep/wiki) from 8555 RNA-Seq samples. Data was collected and prepared by Genotype-Tissue Expression ([GTEx](https://www.gtexportal.org/home/) v6) project. 
TheAIR has one of the largest collection of CDR3 sequences (n=3.6 million) and tissue types (n=53). 

## Quick Start

We have characterized the individual immunoglobulin repertoires using the following measured:
  

* Number of distinct clonotypes per one million raw RNA-Seq reads (CPM)
* Number of Ig-derived reads per one million raw RNA-Seq reads (igRPM)
* Immune diversity measured by Shannon entropy. This takes into account both the number of distinct clonotypes and their relative abundances (immune.diversity)
